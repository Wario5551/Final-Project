# Final-Project
This is a project that I made as my final for the Bethel School of Technology. It's main purpose is to focus on how legumes are affected differently by
things such as the level of nitrogen in the soil and whether or not there are rhizobia present in the soil. This allows for comparisons of the different
factors so as to come to a clear conclusion on how there is a clear affect on the legumes involved in the data set.
